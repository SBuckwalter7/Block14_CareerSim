This is my personal website

I have three pages the user can see, about.html, index.html, and portfolio.html
I have two pages they can not see style.css and javascript.css

There is a header on all three pages, with links in a nav bar that all work

There is personal content on each page as well as an image

There are div cards, and formatted css assignments to every page

If you check the console there is console log that says 'hello world'

I have multiple branches for each section as well as multiple commits

I also have a descriptice ReadMe file
